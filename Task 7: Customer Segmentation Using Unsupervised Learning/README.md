## Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

### Objective

Group customers into distinct segments based on their demographics and purchasing behavior to enable targeted marketing.

### Key Concepts

* Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
* K-Means Clustering
* Elbow Method & Silhouette Score
* PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
* Data Visualization

### Dataset

**Mall Customers Dataset**
Columns include:
`CustomerID`, `Genre`, `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, `Spending Score (1-100)`

### Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning & Label Encoding (`Genre`)
2. Feature Selection & Scaling
3. Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters
4. K-Means Clustering Implementation
5. PCA for 2D Visualization of Clusters
6. Insights derived for marketing strategies

### Results

* Optimal number of clusters: **5**
* Clearly separated customer groups based on income and spending patterns
* Visual representation of customer segments

### Skills Gained

* Customer Behavior Analysis
* Clustering & Interpretation
* Visual Analytics for Business Insight
* Data Preprocessing & Scaling for ML
